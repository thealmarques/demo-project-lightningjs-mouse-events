# Mouse events library for [LightningJS](https://github.com/rdkcentral/Lightning)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thealmarques/lightningjs-mouse-events.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Library intended to replicate mouse events that we would have with our multiple HTML tags that build up a page.

# Features

The library currently supports at 100% the following mouse events
  - click
  - mouseup
  - mousedown
  - mouseup

# How it works

In the [LightningJS docs](https://rdkcentral.github.io/Lightning/docs/introduction/introduction) we can see that the elements that compose our application are built using the concept of tags. All of these tags have screen positions (encapsulated within each other).

For example,
```sh
MouseEvents.listen(this.tag("Menu"), 'click', (element, _) => {
    // Write your logic
});
```
To listen to events in a specific tag you need to specify the template tag, provide the mouse event and a callback that has two arguments, the element found (for example, the element clicked) and the [HTML mouse event](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_mouseevent.asp). This last one is useful when you didn't find anything and want to create some logic. The type of the element will depend on your template.

You can also:
  - Get the screen position {x, y} of a tag using
```sh
    const fieldCoordinates = MouseEvents.getBoundingClientRect(this.tag("Field"));
```

### Installation

For now, you only need to export the src files into your project. In the future, it will be created an npm package.

### Demo

To test the demo project you need to

```sh
$ cd demo
$ yarn install
$ lng dev
```

Visit localhost:8080 and voil√°.
